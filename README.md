# Inky's Tantacletastic Spellbook
As I grew more and more annoyed with missing information on the classic D&D 5e spellsheet I started thinking about a possible alternative. And as things go: it got out of hand pretty quickly. Now, this turned into a fully fledged spell-manager for 5e D&D. Very much in progress, check the feature-list and to-do list for current and upcoming planned functionalities!
